# Service ::::
- EXPOSE YOUR SERvices in your cluster or network associated. 
- when your multiple pod is runnung manage traffic on that 
- The available type values and their behaviors are:

ClusterIP
Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. 
Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. 
This is the default that is used if you don't explicitly specify a type for a Service. 
You can expose the Service to the public internet using an Ingress or a Gateway.

NodePort
Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). 
To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, 
the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.

LoadBalancer
Exposes the Service externally using an external load balancer. 
Kubernetes does not directly offer a load balancing component; 
you must provide one, or you can integrate your Kubernetes cluster with a cloud provider.

ExternalName
Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field 
(for example, to the hostname api.foo.bar.example). 
The mapping configures your cluster's DNS server to return a CNAME record with 
that external hostname value. No proxying of any kind is set up.

wordpress application pod ----------> database pod 

now wordpress need pod details of db  ----- hostname will be db-svc-name.db-namespace.svc.cluster.local


Secret :::: 
- kubernetes secret used for manage senstive data in kubernets 
- kubernetes secret uses secret data using base64 encode 
- all type admin password keys tls and token can be manage by secret 
- secret can be applied in yaml using env
