# kubernetes :::: Container Orchestration Platform

Containers :::: that is help to run enviorment and spin app in isolated env over docker or smilier.

Docker podman Nomad ---- container spin 

--- swarm HA , entrprise application , service discovery or multi managent 

Orchestration refers to the coordination and management of complex, automated IT systems, applications, and services to streamline workflows. 

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services that facilitate both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

- Enchaned level Networking 
- Self Healing method 
- service Discovery and Load Balancing 
- scaling contianers and pods in Horizonatal 
- without changing conf or remove container update and rollback your services 

Kubernetes Architecture ::::

cluster method ::: kind cluster --- procution grade EKS; own cluster 
minikube ::: dev enviorment --- single node 
k8s :::: racher lightweight kubernetes env. 
openshift :::: manage by redhat purchase 

componet :::: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/ 

control plan :::: kubernetes cluster manage maintain known as a master node  
worker node :::: kubernetes cluster provide worker setup to run all application and services

3 Node setup (1 master and 2 worker ) --- bare min. 
bare min 2 cpu and 2 gb Ram min 

- kubeadm : cluster management command 
- kubectl : client command to pass instructions 

# Key component :::::
# -----------------------------------> 
apiserver :::: 
- whole kubernetes services respones over http//https api calls 
- kubernetes manage services using api as well intruction provide in api requests 
- The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
- kubectl command paas any requests may cli or yaml api server.

etcd ::::
- its like a kubernetes configuration database; key value method use to store data
- If your Kubernetes cluster uses etcd as its backing store, make sure you have a back up plan for the data.
- if your service failure ; recovery try using config 

schduler :::
- scdule container and pod on kubernetes workers nodes 
- as per resourece requirement and node capability according 

controll manager ::: 
- controll manager help you to process your services in cluster 
- node to node communication and services workflow manage 
- api https renewal certs and ca certs
- There are many different types of controllers. Some examples of them are:

    1. Node controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
    2. Job controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
    3. EndpointSlice controller: Populates EndpointSlice objects (to provide a link between Services and Pods).
    4. ServiceAccount controller: Create default ServiceAccounts for new namespaces.

kubelet ::: 
- its kubernetes service deamon 
- like you can start stop reload your services using one central daemon serveices 


kube-proxy :::: 
- manage network connection and proxy availablity 

other service 

CoreDns :::: name base resolution of services 
flannel // weave // other cni  :::: pod-pod // network communiation

pod ::::: 

- pod manage containers in kubenretes
- pod is a smallest unit of compute resource ( cpu and memory )
- pod is provide containers need like storage network and enviorments and contexts 
- pod can run with single or multiple containers

2 Nodes ---- 1 master and 1 worker 

# namespace :: namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.

- namespace is a isloated enviorment in kubenretes , that provide segrigation. 

Initial namespaces
Kubernetes starts with four initial namespaces:

- default
    Kubernetes includes this namespace so that you can start using your new cluster without first creating a namespace.
- kube-node-lease
    This namespace holds Lease objects associated with each node. Node leases allow the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control plane can detect node failure.
- kube-public
    This namespace is readable by all clients (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect of this namespace is only a convention, not a requirement.
- kube-system
    The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system.
