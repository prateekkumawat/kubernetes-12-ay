# Workload :
- Running application in kubernetes cluster known as a workload  
- for a workload managemnet uses multiple way in kubernetes 
1. pod ::: 
pod is a smallest unit of compute that Running and manage container in kubernetes. 

Deployment :::: 
- A Deployment manages a set of Pods to run an application workload, usually one that doesn't maintain state.
deployment provide a facilites to scale application from your current to desire state 


Use Case
The following are typical use cases for Deployments:

Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.
Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created, and the Deployment gradually scales it up while scaling down the old ReplicaSet, ensuring Pods are replaced at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.
Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.

Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load.

Pause the rollout of a Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.

Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

Clean up older ReplicaSets that you don't need anymore.
